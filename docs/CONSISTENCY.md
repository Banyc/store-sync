# Consistency

A defect in this file is **two things that must agree, disagreeing**. That is the
whole method, and it is deliberately bounded: a disagreement is deterministic, so
it can be found by a sweep, decided by reading two definitions, and fixed without
enumerating the space around it.

**Out of scope by decision:** races, interleavings, and TOCTOU windows. They cost
unbounded effort to chase and produce findings that are stated residuals anyway.
Where one is known it is recorded as a residual with the window named, not
pursued. The identity-based overlap refusal is correct when it runs; a mount
installed between the check and the walk is that kind of residual.

## The axes

| # | Two things that must agree | Examples this has caught |
|---|---|---|
| A | a doc claim ↔ the code | path-limit formula, `O(D²)` vs the measured exponent, "carries the refusal", "at least as broad as the host's fold", the removed `remove_dir_all` remedy, a stale line citation |
| B | `foo` ↔ `foo_fd` (one spelling guarded, the other not) | the lock-record guard, the residue guard, `validate_rel`/`parse` |
| C | local view ↔ wire view ↔ copy view | three accepted out-of-root escapes |
| D | a predicate's name ↔ the question it answers | `is_reserved_name` offered as an oracle; the temp/id overlap; the trailing-dot id hole |
| E | what `parse` accepts ↔ what every operation does with it | totality gaps |
| F | a constant ↔ its derivation ↔ the resource's limit | `NAME_MAX` temp overflow, the `sun_path` reserve, the path-limit parity |
| G | an error class ↔ the condition it reports | legacy marker vs corruption; `Err(_) => Absent`; a removal-worded message on a create |
| H | a test's name ↔ the failure it can express | a tautological assertion; a false proof in `id_macro.rs`; a count-based bound test blind to quadratic |
| I | an audit pin ↔ the actual count | the funnel `openat` count |
| J | the `unix` ↔ `windows` twin surface | a public function present on one platform only |

## Findings

**A — line-number citations drift.** The README cited `src/atomic/unix.rs:2031`
and `:2309` for two primitives; those lines are now doc text. A stale citation
reads as verified, and this class has already recurred once (a `:2302` citation
that was seven lines off). **Fixed** by citing items by NAME everywhere in
`README.md`; line numbers are no longer used.

**B/D — the one gate answered to two names, one of them misleading.**
`atomic::refuse_lock_record_mutation` was `refuse_reserved_mutation(rel,
Sanction::None)` — it runs BOTH the lock-record half and the residue half — while
its own doc block said there was deliberately no lock-only function. Call sites
were split between the two names, so a reader asking "does this primitive also
refuse a stranded aside?" could not tell from the call. **Fixed:** all 23 call
sites were verified to be `Sanction::None` — no site intended only the lock half,
which is what the design says cannot exist — so the alias was deleted and every
site now names `refuse_reserved_mutation(…, Sanction::None)`.

**F — a duplicated constant across the platform twins.** `MAX_ANCESTRY` was
defined independently in `atomic/unix.rs` and `atomic/windows.rs`, both `1 << 16`.
The two ports enforce the same rule, so the values must agree; two literals are
free to drift. **Fixed:** single-sourced as `atomic::MAX_ANCESTRY`, referenced by
both ports.

**F (resolved, no action) — `SUN_PATH_BYTES` ×2 is correct.** One definition is
`#[cfg(unix)]` and computed from the platform's `sockaddr_un`; the other is the
`#[cfg(not(unix))]` placeholder so the module compiles everywhere. A `cfg`-gated
alternative is not a duplication.

**G — an error becomes a destructive decision.** On a candidate-removal path the
code computes `confirmed = match rooted(&path) { Ok(rel) => …, Err(_) => false }`
and treats "not confirmed" as permission to remove. An error there is silently
converted into a reason to delete. Per the crate's own rule 8 this must fail
closed. **Open.**

**G — `RenamedEntryLocation::Unknown` collapses every probe error.** The comment
says the location cannot be confirmed so nothing is named; whether that is
fail-closed depends on what consumes `Unknown`. **Open:** verify the consumer.

**J — the public surface is not the same on both platforms.**
`atomic::{fsync_dir_fd, openat_no_follow, openat_no_follow_io,
remove_dir_all_path}` exist on unix and not on windows, while both ports
`pub use …::*` into the same `atomic` namespace. A consumer using any of them
compiles on unix and fails on windows — and the two `openat_*` forms are
inherently POSIX, so the choice is to demote them or to state the platform in
the API, not to pretend they are neutral. **Open.**

**E — the accepted set and the operations over it.** `validate_rel` accepts
`a/./b`, `a/b/` and `a//b`; `RootedRelativePath::parse` refuses a literal `.`
segment. Any primitive that takes a raw path therefore re-validates against a
rule STRICTER OR LOOSER than the one at the boundary. **Fixed** by API
constraint #1: the boundary is the type, `validate_rel` is deleted, and the
delta was measured to be **one-directional** — the type refuses a strict
superset, the only newly-refused inputs being spellings with a non-leading
literal `.` segment. No input the guard refused is now accepted.

**I — an audit pin moved, deliberately.** When `remove_dir_all_path` left
production the pinned `std::fs`/`libc` counts dropped with it (`remove_file`,
`rmdir`, `open`). That is the pin doing its job: the count changed, so the
change had to say so.
